            <p>7Magnolia is dedicated to ensuring our website is accessible to as many visitors as possible regardless of sensory, vision, cognitive, and mobility challenges. We have an active commitment to increasing our site's website accessibility. Our site currently complies with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1, Level AA criteria.</p>
            <p>To create a more inclusive experience, our site honors OS settings for light or dark theme and allows for manual adjustment as well. The site also honors OS settings to reduce motion.</p>
            <p>We will continue to improve the accessibility of our site as practices and standards evolve. Currently, we are working on incorporating language options, assisting focus, and reducing cognitive load.</p>
            <p>Despite our efforts to adhere to W3C standards, our form is built using a CRM which does not give us permission to make proper accessibility adjustments. We are also working towards improving this experience.</p>
            <p>We welcome suggestions and ideas to make our site more accessible for all. If you have difficultly with our site or would like to make a suggestion, please contact us at <a aria-label="Send an email to info@7magnolia.com" href="mailto:info@7magnolia.com">info@7magnolia.com</a>.</p>
